<h2>Train Activity</h2>
<p>This web application stores and calculates information about train schedules. The application first displays<br>
 the schedule of the current trains stored in the Firebase data base. Next it asks the user to enter a new trains<br>
 information and then calculates the next arrival time of the new train against current time and stores that information<br>
 in the Firebase data base. Next time the application begins the new train's information well be displayed in the train <br>
 schedules chart. Thank you for using this application.
